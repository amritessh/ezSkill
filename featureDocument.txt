ezSkill: Hyper-Personalized Micro-Learning Paths
1. Idea & Vision
Product Name: ezSkill
Tagline: Master new skills, effortlessly. Your AI-powered learning journey.

Vision: To democratize personalized education by intelligently curating adaptive learning paths tailored to individual learners' current knowledge, preferred styles, and career aspirations. ezSkill aims to provide a frictionless, highly effective, and engaging learning experience by leveraging the vast resources of the internet and cutting-edge AI.

Problem Solved:

Learning Inefficiency: Learners struggle to find relevant, sequential content, leading to wasted time and frustration.
Lack of Personalization: One-size-fits-all courses don't adapt to individual needs, leading to disengagement and high dropout rates.
Information Overload: Overwhelming number of online resources makes it hard to identify high-quality, relevant materials.
Disconnected Learning: Difficult to map abstract learning to concrete career goals and industry demands.
Target Audience:

Individual Professionals: Seeking to rapidly acquire new skills for career advancement or transitions.
Students: Supplementing formal education, filling knowledge gaps, or preparing for specific certifications.
Small to Medium Businesses (SMBs): Looking for scalable, personalized training solutions for their workforce.
2. Core Features (MVP Focus)
The MVP will establish the foundational loop of "Assess -> Plan -> Learn -> Adapt."

2.1. User Management & Onboarding
User Registration & Login: Secure account creation via email/password or OAuth (Google, GitHub).
Initial Skill Assessment: Interactive quizzes or text-based input to gauge current knowledge across predefined skill domains (e.g., Python, Data Science, Cloud Computing).
Learning Goal Definition: Users articulate specific skills to acquire or career roles they aspire to (e.g., "Become a Certified AWS Solutions Architect," "Master React Development").
Learning Style Preference: Users select preferred learning modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, kinesthetic) and resource types (e.g., video tutorials, articles, interactive exercises, code examples).
2.2. Dynamic Learning Path Generation
Personalized Path Creation: AI generates a sequence of micro-lessons using externally curated content, customized to the user's assessment, goals, and learning style.
Micro-Lesson Sequencing: Paths are logically ordered, ensuring foundational prerequisites are covered before advanced topics (leveraging the Neo4j Knowledge Graph).
Resource Recommendations: Each micro-lesson links to high-quality external online resources (articles, videos, interactive labs).
Path Visualization: An interactive dashboard displays the learning path, indicating progress and upcoming modules.
2.3. Adaptive Learning & Feedback
Progress Tracking: Users mark modules/resources as complete.
Reinforcement Quizzes: Short, contextual quizzes after modules to confirm understanding.
Real-time Adaptation: If a user struggles (e.g., fails a quiz, flags a topic as difficult), the AI dynamically adjusts the path by:
Recommending prerequisite content.
Offering alternative learning resources tailored to their preferred style.
Proposing a simplified explanation.
"Explain-It-To-Me" (Conceptual Explainer): Users can highlight a concept and request a simpler, analogy-driven explanation.
2.4. Content Ingestion & Curation Pipeline
Automated Content Fetching (MVP: Curated Sources): Ingests content from a pre-defined, high-quality list (e.g., specific educational websites, open-source documentation, reputable public datasets).
Text Extraction & Chunking: Processes fetched content (e.g., video transcripts, article text) into smaller, semantically meaningful segments.
Embedding Generation: Converts each content chunk into a high-dimensional vector embedding.
Metadata Extraction & Graph Linking: Extracts key topics, skills, and prerequisites from content, linking them into the Neo4j Knowledge Graph.
3. Tech Stack Deep Dive & How Everything Ties Together
ezSkill employs a microservices architecture deployed on Kubernetes, integrating MLOps for its AI components.

Frontend (React/Next.js):
Purpose: User interface, interactive learning dashboard.
Interaction: Communicates with the Backend (Node.js) API via REST calls. Uses Supabase JS SDK for direct client-side authentication and potentially real-time progress updates.
Backend (Node.js - Express.js/NestJS):
Purpose: API Gateway, Core Business Logic, Orchestration.
Tools: Express.js (lightweight) or NestJS (structured, opinionated for large apps), TypeScript for type safety, Node.js PostgreSQL client library.
Interaction:
Receives requests from Frontend.
Uses Supabase JS SDK for core data (user profiles, learning paths, progress) and Auth.
Publishes events to Kafka (e.g., user_assessments, learning_progress_updates) to trigger asynchronous AI agent processing.
Consumes events from Kafka (e.g., generated_paths, skill_gap_analysis) to update Supabase and push results to Frontend.
Makes HTTP requests to AI Agent services for synchronous calls (e.g., "Explain-It-To-Me").
Uses Redis client library for caching, rate limiting, and session management.
Queries Neo4j (via its Node.js driver) for logical skill dependencies and prerequisites.
AI Agent Services (Python - FastAPI/Flask/Gunicorn):
Purpose: Independent microservices housing the core AI logic. Python remains ideal here due to its rich AI/ML ecosystem.
Tools: LangChain / LlamaIndex (for Model Context Protocol and RAG orchestration), OpenAI/Anthropic APIs (for LLMs), Sentence Transformers (for embeddings).
Interaction:
Consume relevant events from Kafka (e.g., path_recalculation_requests) to trigger their processing.
Perform RAG queries against Pinecone (Vector Database) to retrieve semantically relevant content.
Perform queries against Neo4j (Graph Database) to understand logical relationships (prerequisites, skill hierarchies).
Use LLMs (via API calls) to generate personalized content, paths, or explanations, augmented by RAG.
Publish results back to Kafka (e.g., generated_paths, skill_gap_analysis).
Content Ingestion Service (Python - FastAPI/Flask/Gunicorn):
Purpose: Automated pipeline for fetching, processing, and indexing learning content.
Tools: PyPDF2/pdfminer.six, web scraping libs, Sentence Transformers.
Interaction:
Triggered by Prefect/Dagster (ML Pipeline Orchestrator) or by new content events on Kafka.
Fetches content, extracts text, performs chunking.
Generates embeddings and indexes them into Pinecone (Vector DB).
Extracts metadata (topics, skills) and inserts/updates nodes and relationships in Neo4j (Graph DB).
Stores original files in Supabase Storage.
Databases:
Supabase (PostgreSQL): Relational data (users, progress, metadata), Authentication, File Storage. The core relational data store.
Pinecone (Vector Database): Stores all vector embeddings for fast similarity search (Core of RAG).
Neo4j (Graph Database): Stores the explicit Knowledge Graph of skills, concepts, relationships, and dependencies.
How it all ties together (Example Flow: Adapting a Learning Path after a Quiz):

User Action (Frontend): User completes a quiz on a topic and submits answers.
Backend (Node.js): Receives quiz results. Validates answers, updates user_progress in Supabase. Publishes a learning_progress_updates event (including quiz score, topic, and user ID) to Kafka.
ML Pipeline Orchestrator (Prefect/Dagster): Listens to learning_progress_updates on Kafka. If the user struggled on the quiz, it triggers the RecalculateLearningPath ML pipeline for that user.
Adaptive Path Agent (AI Service): This agent is a consumer of the RecalculateLearningPath pipeline (or directly listens to a Kafka topic).
Receives the user's updated progress and identified difficulty area.
RAG (Pinecone): Converts the difficult topic/skill into an embedding. Queries Pinecone for semantically similar, alternative learning resources, or simpler content related to that topic.
Neo4j (Graph DB): Queries Neo4j to identify direct prerequisites for the struggled topic. If the user missed foundational knowledge, it identifies those prerequisite skills/concepts that need to be revisited.
LLM (LangChain/LlamaIndex): Uses LangChain/LlamaIndex to orchestrate RAG. The LLM receives a prompt with retrieved context from Pinecone (alternative resources) and logical pathways from Neo4j (prerequisites). It generates an adapted learning path, inserting review modules or simpler explanations.
Output: Publishes an adapted_paths event to Kafka.
Backend (Node.js): Consumes the adapted_paths event from Kafka. Stores the updated path in Supabase.
Frontend (React/Next.js): Fetches the new, adapted learning path from the Backend and updates the user's dashboard, showing the revised journey.
